# (WIP) External Random Access Memory (RAM) for the Raspberry Silicon RP2040

This library provides a way to use external RAM with the Raspberry Silicon RP2040. It is based on C. 

## How to use

- For now, I don't know. I'm still working on it.

## How to contribute

- You can contribute by making a pull request. I will review it and merge it if it is good. (Probably your code is better than mine, so I will merge it)

## How to install

- Still, I don't know. 

## How to use

- I am currently developing this library for espressif ESP-PSRAM64 and ESP-PSRAM64H. I will add support for other PSRAM chips later. You can also add support for other PSRAM chips by making a pull request.
